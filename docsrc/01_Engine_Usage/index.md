The Driftwood 2D game engine is simple to configure and use. If your copy was packaged with a game, the game developer should have already configured everything for you. However, it may be desirable to change some of their default settings. Maybe you're trying to get started making your own game, or maybe you just need to know how to turn the thing on. This chapter will teach you the basics of configuring and running the Driftwood 2D engine, as well as introduce some more advanced topics that will be covered later on.
