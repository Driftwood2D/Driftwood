Welcome to the Driftwood 2D User's Manual. Whether you are considering Driftwood 2D for your latest project or just troubleshooting a Driftwood 2D powered game you downloaded somewhere, this manual should familiarize you with the ins and outs of operating this software. This documentation covers everything from basic engine usage to creating your own game.

## About the Contents

The first chapter, ["Engine Usage"](Engine_Usage), describes the basic process of getting the engine up and running. Configuring the engine and using command line options are covered in this chapter. It also gives more detailed explanations of the data path, databases, and the engine log, though most information about these topics can be found in later chapters.
