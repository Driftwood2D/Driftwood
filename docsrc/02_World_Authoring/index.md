Driftwood 2D won't do anything without a World Package. A World Package is a folder or zip file containing at least the file "init.py", an event script to be run on startup. Generally it will also contain all of the data needed to construct a game, such as other scripts, tilemaps, lightmaps, tile and sprite sheets, sounds and music, and descriptor files. This chapter will explain how to put together a World Package from scratch, and go over each type of file that might be found inside and how to make them.
